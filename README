This script runs full PIPER-FlexPepDock protocol. The script uses new Rosetta version, which
is relying om ref2015 score function. To restore the protocol published in
http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005905#sec030
add 'restore_talaris_behaviour' option and make sure you have new Rosetta version as well as Rosetta 2016.20 release

For running jd3_fixbb_design you will need to build your updated Rosetta in MPI and serialization:
scons bin mode=release extras=mpi,serialization

######################## I DON'T LIKE IT #######################
We also provide an old version of make_fragments.pl script which works with this protocol,
and you will ned to define it's local directory at the top of the script along with the other paths.
