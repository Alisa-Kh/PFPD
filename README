This script runs full PIPER-FlexPepDock protocol. The script uses new Rosetta version, which
is relying on ref2015 score function. To restore the protocol published in
http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005905#sec030
add '--restore_talaris_behaviour' option and make sure you have new Rosetta version as well as Rosetta 2016.20 release

For running jd3_fixbb_design you will need to build your updated Rosetta in MPI and serialization:
scons bin mode=release extras=mpi,serialization

An old version of make_fragments.pl script, which works with this protocol, is also provided.

For blind docking (no known complex structure) additional rescoring step is needed.
Although, if native structure is available pass it as an argument to the script with "--native" flag

For minimization add "--receptor_min" flag
