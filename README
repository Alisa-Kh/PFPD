This script runs PIPER-FlexPepDock protocol. The script uses new Rosetta version, which
is relying on ref2015 score function. To restore the protocol published in
http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005905#sec030
add '--restore_talaris_behaviour' option and make sure you have Rosetta 2016.20 release compiled

An old version of make_fragments.pl script, which works with this protocol, is also provided.

If native structure is available pass it as an argument to the script with "--native" flag

For minimization add "--receptor_min" flag

For running the protocol with jd3 pass "--jd3" flag

*For running jd3_fixbb design you will need to build your updated Rosetta in MPI and serialization:
scons bin mode=release extras=mpi,serialization
